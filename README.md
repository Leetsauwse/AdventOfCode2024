# Advent of Code 2024!!

My first year at doing the Advent of Code. All solutions will be posted in here. This year will be done with Deno!

## Usage

### Run a specific day:

```
deno task day1    # Runs day1.ts
deno task day2    # Runs day2.ts
```
*note I originally thought I had a more elegant solution to this, will be working to return it back to something that doesn't require 24 individual lines in the deno.json file*


### Create a new day's file:

`deno task new 4    # Creates day4.ts`
